# DID SOMEONE CALL MY NAME?
Always plugged to the earphones? And had someone call you which you couldn't hear? Well, this repository is aimed to solve one of those challenges.
Currently in its alpha stage, this works in a geeky manner to monitor your audio levels and decrease the volume as the audio levels increase.

Note: This script/software, is not intended to store your audio information at all. The developer deeply believes in the idea of privacy and trust and will never store/share user details without an explicit permission.
The audio levels are monitored at a local level and are not shared/stored in any manner. The repository is open sourced and people are welcome to contribute in any manner they want, I'd be more than happy to see the creative minds come up with new ideas to improve this.

The repository is in its earliest stage at the moment, I shall be working on it regularly to improve the current code and add new features with time.

Till then, plug in your headphones! :D
